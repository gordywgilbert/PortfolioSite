    <ul>
        <li>Maintained a CMS used to connect employers, health insurance brokers, and their carriers throughout
            23 states. The framework was created with Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS3 and MySQL.
        </li>
        <li>Created customizable downloadable reports for our clients as requested. Reports included: missing
            enrollment information, enrollment details, and health history reports, among others. The
